## Introduction {#sec-intro}

### Main Contributions

Please note that the first paragraph of a section or subsection is not indented. The first paragraph that follows a table, figure, equation etc. does not need an indent, either.

Subsequent paragraphs, however, are indented.

### Basket Weaving

#### Underwater Basket Weaving

Only two levels of headings should be numbered. Lower level headings remain unnumbered; they are formatted as run-in headings.

##### Underwater Basket Weaving Under Difficult Circumstances

The contribution should contain no more than four levels of headings. @tbl-headings gives a summary of all heading levels.

::: {#tbl-headings tbl-pos='t'}
```{=latex}
\begin{tabular}{lll}
\toprule
Heading level &  Example & Font size and style\\
\midrule
Title (centered) &  {\Large\bfseries Lecture Notes} & 14 point, bold\\
1st-level heading &  {\large\bfseries 1 Introduction} & 12 point, bold\\
2nd-level heading & {\bfseries 2.1 Printing Area} & 10 point, bold\\
3rd-level heading & {\bfseries Run-in Heading in Bold.} Text follows & 10 point, bold\\
4th-level heading & {\itshape Lowest Level Heading.} Text follows & 10 point, italic\\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
```

Table captions should be placed above the tables.

## Recent Advances from the Mariana Trench

Displayed equations are centered and set on a separate line.

$$
x + y = z
$$ {#eq-linear}

Please try to avoid rasterized images for line-art diagrams and schemas. Whenever possible, use vector graphics instead (see
@fig-duck).

![A figure caption is always placed below the illustration. Please note that short captions are centered, while long ones are justified by the macro package automatically.](example-image-duck){#fig-duck width=100% fig-pos='t'}

\begin{theorem}
This is a sample theorem. The run-in heading is set in bold, while
the following text appears in italics. Definitions, lemmas,
propositions, and corollaries are styled the same way.
\end{theorem}
<!-- %
% the environments 'definition', 'lemma', 'proposition', 'corollary',
% 'remark', and 'example' are defined in the LLNCS documentclass as well.

\begin{proof}
Proofs, examples, and remarks have the initial word in italics,
while the following text appears in normal font.

For citations of references, we prefer the use of square brackets and consecutive numbers. Citations using labels or the author/year
convention are also acceptable. The following bibliography provides a sample reference list with entries for journal articles [@ref_article1], an LNCS chapter [@ref_lncs1], a book [@ref_book1], proceedings without editors [@ref_proc1], and a homepage [@ref_url1]. Multiple citations are grouped [@ref_article1;@ref_lncs1;@ref_book1], [@ref_article1;@ref_book1;@ref_proc1;@ref_url1].

## Experiments

### Experimental Setup

### Experimental Results

## Discussion

## Conclusion

Of course, authors have complete freedom on how they choose to structure their paper. Section headers from Introduction up to and including Conclusions are completely up to the discretion of the authors; use whichever structure you see fit. Title, Abstract, the credits environment, and References, however, are mandatory.

\begin{credits}
\subsubsection{\ackname} A bold run-in heading in small font size at the end of the paper is
used for general acknowledgments, for example: This study was funded
by X (grant number Y).

\subsubsection{\discintname}
It is now necessary to declare any competing interests or to specifically
state that the authors have no competing interests. Please place the
statement with a bold run-in heading in small font size beneath the
(optional) acknowledgments,
for example: The authors have no competing interests to declare that are
relevant to the content of this article. Or: Author A has received research
grants from Company W. Author B has received a speaker honorarium from
Company X and owns stock in Company Y. Author C is a member of committee Z.
